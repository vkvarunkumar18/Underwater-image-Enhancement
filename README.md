# Underwater-image-Enhancement
This project enhances underwater images using deep learning and traditional techniques to address color distortion, low contrast, and blurriness. Features include color restoration, noise reduction, and contrast enhancement. Built with TensorFlow/PyTorch, Python, OpenCV, and PIL, it uses a custom dataset for training and refinement.
